 Pachachi.1.d:0 "Seasoned Iraqi politician and Arab nationalist Muzahim al-Pachachi has left Iraq today. The former Iraqi Prime Minister  helped establish one of the earliest Arab nationalist groups in Iraq and played a large role in drafting the 1925 Iraqi constitution. Through the interwar period he served various cabinet positions and diplomatic postings. He successfully established ties with the USSR, militant anti-colonial leaders and other Arab nationalists, putting him at odds with Iraq’s ruling pro-Western Hashemite king. As Prime Minister he pushed Iraq to heavily involve itself in the liberation of Palestine and his continued push for Palestinian rights infuriated Hashemites in both Iraq and Jordan. The Jordanian dynasty has its own vision for Palestine while the Iraqi king fears his pro-Western stance being undercut by anti-Western nationalists. In recent weeks, pro-British Hashemite supporters and palace officials put immense pressure on Muzahim al-Pachachi to leave Iraq in an effort to curb rising Arab nationalist fervor in Iraq. Although they have succeeded in getting him to leave, many feel Muzahim will simply ally with other Arab nationalists in the region and propagate his message unhindered by Hashemite surveillance."
 CENTO.1.d:0 "The United States has identified the middle east as a vulnerable space through which communism may expand. American efforts to form a Middle East command failed due to anti-colonial sentiments and rising Arab nationalism. Instead the focus has gone to form a “northern tier” and contain communism by linking NATO with SEATO to complete the encirclement of Moscow. This meant forming an alliance that geographically would link Turkey (a NATO member) to Pakistan (a SEATO member). Turkey and Iraq recently signed a treaty of cooperation called the Baghdad Pact which called for joint resistance to outside interference and invited regional states to join in. The United Kingdom, Pakistan, and Iran agreed to join in thus solidifying the Baghdad Pact as a regional alliance of defense, cultural, and economic ties. Although the United States supported this initiative and it fit its regional objectives, it has refused to become a member. This raises questions about how the alliance will cooperate militarily without direct American involvement. Each member state has its own interests and aside from Iran and Turkey, neither Pakistan nor Iraq borders a communist state. On paper the alliance looks strong, but time will tell if in practice it will become a NATO of the Muslim World."
 ARF.1.d:0 "Today, the kingdoms of Iraq and Jordan, have announced to form an Arab Federation, which many see as a response to the United Arab Republic, formed by Egypt and Syria. King Faisal of Iraq and his cousin, King Hussain of Jordan, both descendants of the Hashemite dynasty, that ruled Arabia till 1921, have disclosed that they had long been planning an Arabic union of states. This union, is seen as a direct consequence of Iraq leaving the Baghdad Pact and to ensure the country's independence from their western Arabic counterpart, Egypt.Although a federation by name, many see the new state to be a confederation and has upset a lot of people. The United Arab Republic has yet to make any formal statement on this, though there are reports of Israeli mobilization . Nevertheless, this is a monumental step for the Middle East, and possibly for the world."
 Faisal.1.d:0 "Today, King Faisal II of Iraq achieved his majority and has taken his place as ruler of Iraq. Although he ascended the throne at age 4 in 1939 following the death of King Ghazi, his father, the country had been governed by his regent and pro-British uncle Prince ‘Abd al-llah. King Faisal II started the coronation by traveling in an open carriage led by smartly dressed cavalrymen to attend the Iraqi Majlis. He entered the parliament with troops at attention in ceremonial uniforms, all along European lines. After addressing the Majlis, King Faisal II took the oath of kingship and accepted a pledge of loyalty from the Majlis and Iraqi people by the President of the Senate. Following the ceremony the King attended a massive reception where he hosted notable dignitaries, including the Duke of Gloucester. The European style uniforms and practices throughout the coronation indicates King Faisal II hopes to continue the policies of his uncle. Whether he can contain the rising threat of pan-Arabism and Arab nationalism remains uncertain as despite the magnificent ceremony, there were reports of Iraqis from middle class neighborhoods complaining of the coronation’s expenses. In working class districts some Iraqis were put off by an event where the King was surrounded by armed guards and not the people of Iraq."
 Suwaidi.1.d:0 "Tawfiq al-Suwaidi has decided to accept King Faisal II’s invitation to form a new government and work with the Hashemites. A brilliant lawyer and former Prime Minister who grew up in the late Ottoman Empire, al-Suwaidi rose to prominence during the British mandate era. Today, he is a seasoned politician and international figure. The Hashemites had hoped his pro-Western leanings would translate to support for their regime but al-Suwaidi has historically proven himself to be a believer in Western principals of representative democracy and individual rights. The Iraqi royal family viewed his previous stints as Prime Minister with suspicion as he allowed political parties to function and directed the interior ministry to relax its operations, particularly against leftists. However, the situation Iraq finds itself in requires strong leadership and a man of al-Suwaidi’s experience and reputation outweighs the risks of his lifting government restrictions and surveillance of dubious groups in the country. For Tawfiq al-Suwaidi he has had a long history of clashing with the Hashemites but he too feels the time maybe right for a more successful relationship and perhaps a more democratic Iraq."
 Central_League_Games.1.d:0 "The Iraq Central League consists of football teams from clubs and institutions based across Baghdad. Despite being one of four regional leagues in the country, the Iraqi Central League is considered the premier Iraqi football league. Its champions go on to represent Iraq in the Asia Club Championship. The Haris Al-Maliki club is considered the powerhouse club in the country. However, all the matches appear to be popular, as they often attract sold out crowds. In addition, many Iraqis follow the results closely in the media with hopes their team can come out on top. Major institutions like the police and army also field teams giving members of such institutions more reasons to support their team. The Iraqi football love keeps the population happy during the league season and allows rival institutions to resolve their tensions on the pitch instead of on the streets. What a beautiful game it is."	
 Ayoubi.1.d:0 "Ali Jawdad al-Ayoubi has long served the Hashemites in Iraq. After serving for Faisal’s short-lived Syria regime he followed him to Iraq. He took on major leadership positions and diplomatic posts, including several stints as Prime Minister for Iraq. Al-Ayoubi, a seasoned political leader recognizes the changing global order following the end of World War II. In a dramatic diplomatic maneuver, al-Ayoubi flew to Washington D.C. to personally open an Iraqi embassy in the American capital. The Iraqi government recognizes the British are not the paramount power it once was. If the Hashemites are to survive against the rise of anti-monarchal, pan-Arab nationalism and communist agitation it will need to strengthen its ties with the Americans and the new embassy will be the first step in this process. Media in the US reported local excitement and interest to the senior Iraqi leader’s dramatic decision to fly in to personally open an embassy. In Iraq the move is praised as recognizing the global order while anti-monarchists point to this action as Iraq continuing to surrender its sovereignty to colonial forces."
 Constitution_Party.1.d:0 "Frustration and anger towards the political repression in Iraq and British interference has boiled over to protests and strikes against the monarchy and the 1948 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. For far too long, the protestors believe, Iraq has had its foreign policy dictated by London while the Hashemite dynasty curtailed any expressions of political discourse. In the midst of this unrest, King Faisal II published a public denouncement against the Constitution Party. He says the party has fanned the protestors anger and has sought to provoke a civil war in the name of its own political gains. He says in reality much of what the protestors are complaining about are actually caused by the Constitution Party and because the protests are targeting the royal family, the Constitution Party refuses to help calm the unrest. This condemnation of the Constitution Party has surprised many in Iraq and it remains to be seen if the King’s effort to place the blame and responsibility on the Party will aid its ability to calm down the unrest sweeping Iraq."
 IRQ_Reign.1.d:0 "Iraq is perhaps the most arbitrarily designed state that emerged from World War I. The British merged three distinct Ottoman provinces to create Iraq. The new state lacked ethnic, religious, or linguistic homogeneity. The Arab majority was divided into Sunnis and Shias. The country had a sizable Kurdish minority concentrated in the north. A sizable Assyrian Christian population existed along with a large Jewish community in Baghdad. The British sought to rule Iraq through treaties with a friendly government to secure its interests and avoid expenses. Faisal ibn Hussein, recently deposed by the French in Syria, was brought by the British to become King Faisal I of Iraq. Despite lacking any connection to the land, King Faisal I proved adept at mediating Iraq’s factions and establishing the legitimacy of his dynasty with the people. His death in 1933 brought the inept King Ghazi to the throne. After King Ghazi’s death in 1939, the three-year-old King Faisal II took over but power rests with the regent, Prince Abdullah. King Faisal I’s early death saw parliament dominated by aging Ottoman-era politicians who constantly rotate power in parliament. The military has overthrown several premiers since Prince Abdullah's regency began, though they have chosen to not overthrow the system.  World War II witnessed the Hashemite’s biggest challenge as nationalist army officers seized power. The Hashemites and parliament returned to power only after a British invasion, forever tainting the Hashemite state in the eyes of an increasingly nationalistic population.  The Iraqi state's centralizing policy saw brutal repression as the army suppressed the Kurds and Assyrians. In addition to resistance to centralization, the anti-colonial middle class and leftist agitation among urban workers are all emerging threats to the Hashemite Iraqi state. Time will tell if King Faisal II can end the political uncertainty and restore the people’s trust in the dynasty."
