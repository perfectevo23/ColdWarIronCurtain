Following the conversion of the Roman emperor the religion emerged as the dominant faith in both the Western and Eastern Roman Empire. Over the centuries, Christianity was wracked by schisms but emerged as the dominant faith across Europe and neighboring areas. The advent of colonialism and proselytizing missions have spread the faith across the globe, making Christianity the largest faith and most spread out faith on the planet."

Catholics believe their church was founded by Jesus and its bishops are the successors of the apostles. The church and its followers continue to adhere to the traditional practices of the church and follow the clergy directed by the Pope. Today, Catholicism is present in almost every nation and although the church lacks the political influence of its earlier days, the church remains an immense influence over its followers, especially in Europe and South America."
 ReligionChristianityProtestant_desc:0 "Protestantism refers to a number of religious movements that emerged in the sixteenth century during the Reformation. Its founders disagreed with Catholic doctrine, especially with regards to the secular powers of the church, the role of its clergy, and some of the religious practices. The Protestant church sought to spread vernacular knowledge of the Bible and end what they saw as superstitious practices of the Catholic church. Today there are many different Protestant churches and their followers are present in large numbers across Western Europe and the United States."
 ReligionChristianityOrthodox_desc:0 "The Orthodox Church views itself as the church of apostolic succession, and believes the Roman Catholic Church of the Pope left the church during the Great Schism of 1054. The schism occurred over disputes on the status of Papal primacy, and changes to interpretations that the Pope attempted to impose. The Orthodox Church is not a single church, but a collective of churches in communion, thus each church has different leaders and varying liturgical traditions. The church has followers in the Balkans, Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean. Despite the rise of Islam and more recently Communism in Eastern Europe, efforts of the faithful within the countries and the diaspora allow it to persevere."
 ReligionChristianityOriental_desc:0 "The Oriental Orthodox Church differentiates from other denominations with the doctrine that Jesus Christ himself has a singular nature as opposed to human and divine as done in the Council of Chalecedon. Oriental Orthodoxy has shaped the histories of Armenia, Egypt, Assyria, Eastern Africa and even Kerala in India. The Oriental Orthodox Church is not a single church, but a collective of churches in communion, thus each church has different leaders and varying liturgical traditions."
 #Judaic#
 ReligionJudaic:0 "Judaic"
 ReligionJudaic_desc:0 "Judaism is the first and oldest Abrahamic monotheistic religion. It is often considered an ethnic religion with its adherents being the descendants of the Bronze Age Israelites. Followers of Judaism generally adhere to oral traditions, the Tanakh, and other traditional scriptures. Abraham is viewed as the first Hebrew and from his bloodline, the Jewish community emerged. Many followers describe Judaism as the expression of the covenant God made with the Israelites and their descendants. Over the centuries Jewish communities spread across the globe, especially in Europe and the Middle East, playing leading roles in the development of sciences, social theories, and commerce. However, as a perpetual minority they have faced periods of intense persecution and in recent times, a genocide in Europe. Israel is the one Jewish state, but Jewish diaspora communities continue to exist across the globe."
 
 ReligionJudaism:0 "Judaism (Judaic)"
 ReligionJudaism_desc:0 "There are multiple interpretations of the religious texts, oral traditions, and practices of the faith. This seeming flexibility in identity has to do with the ethnic religious nature of the faith. Generally, almost all followers of Judaism see themselves as descendants of Abraham. Although most Jewish religious rites can be performed by a follower, legal questions and interpretations are generally directed to religious scholars called Rabbis who provide guidance and knowledge to followers. In recent times the emergence of nationalism, secularism, and rationalism have seen new interpretations and congregations emerge. Although Israel is a Jewish state, the Jewish diaspora continues to exist and thrive across the globe. However, communities remaining in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa do face persecution."
 #Islamic#
 ReligionIslamic:0 "Islamic"
 ReligionIslamic_desc:0 "Islam emerged as in the seventh century and is the most recent Abrahamic monotheistic faith. Its followers, called Muslims, believe in the absolute supremacy of God, translated to Allah in Arabic. They believe the last prophet of God was Muhammad who revealed the Quran which Muslims hold as the unfiltered words of God. Despite a schism over who inherited political power following the death of Muhammad, Islam grew rapidly, whether through conflict, trade, mystics, or missionaries. Today Islam is present across the globe but especially prevalent in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and parts of Europe. European imperialism saw much of the Islamic world colonized. With decolonization emerging, many Muslim societies must debate whether a return to traditional practices or an embrace of modernization are the keys to ensure the protection and health of their societies."

There is no formal clergy, many Sunni Muslims often look to religious scholars for advice on spirituality, living, and law. Legal arguments and rulings made by religious scholars are based on the Quran, hadiths, along with reasoning. Sunni Islam emerged during the bitter conflicts over who should succeed Muhammad. Today, both denominations have established divergent legal jurisprudence. Presently, the vast majority of Muslims globally are Sunni and they generally are the largest Muslim population in all Muslim states except Iran. In Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq, they are not in the overwhelming majority."
 ReligionIslamShia_desc:0 "The second largest denomination of Islam globally. Its origins lie in the disputes over who would succeed Muhammad after he passed away. The Shias, unlike Sunnis felt the successions were unjust and they revere the assassinated Ali and Husayn as martyrs. Although both denominations accept the importance of the Five Pillars and supremacy of the Quran, the legal rulings of Shia scholars diverged from the Sunni legal schools. In addition, Twelver Shias, have a formal clergy of scholars with various ranks to provide rulings and guidance to the community. Shia Muslims are the clear majority in Iran and a majority in Iraq, but have large minority populations across the Middle East and South Asia."
 ReligionIslamIbadi_desc:0 "Ibadi Islam though a much smaller denomination is perhaps the oldest one still active. Ibadi Islam emerged only twenty years after the death of Muhammad as an opposition to the third Caliph. Conflicts with later Caliphs saw the sect driven to the interior of modern-day Oman. Ibadis eventually formed an elected imamate in the country. Although both Sunni and Shia scholars view the group suspiciously, their practices and beliefs are very similar though they have doctrinal differences with both Sunnis and Shias. Ibadis are the majority community only in Oman, however, there are Ibadi communities in North Africa."

Its origins have been traced to India but it in the ensuing centuries it spread across Asia.

There are several major branches of the faith that are generally divided by geographical space. Despite the rise of different religions and in recent years colonialism, Buddhism remains a highly influential and popular religion."

The spiritual goal of Vajrayana practitioners is to achieve enlightenment by pursuing the path of Buddhahood. They believe tantras are the most effective way to achieve spiritual goals. It does share similarities with the Mahayana traditions and uses their texts. However, unlike other Buddhist traditions, Vajrayana does not require its practitioners to banish negative feelings like greed or hatred but to instead use it on their path to enlightenment. Vajrayana is firmly established in the Himalayas, Tibet, Mongolia, and parts of eastern Russia."
 ReligionBuddhismMahayana_desc:0 "The largest tradition of Buddhism, its followers seek enlightenment through the path of Bodhisattava for the benefit of all of humanity. Followers of Mahayana believe enlightenment is achievable for everyone within one lifetime. The tradition traces its origin to the first century CE. Followers of Mahayana are not bound to any specific doctrine, texts, or practices. Its teachings are diverse enough that it can accommodate many different forms of teaching. It is particularly prevalent in East Asia, China, and Vietnam."
 ReligionBuddhismThereveda_desc:0 "Theravada is the oldest tradition of Buddhism still existing, tracing its origins to around the third century BCE. Its followers have preserved their texts into a collection called the Pali Canon which is the oldest and only collection of the teachings of Buddha in its original text that exists today. Pali, a classical Indian language serves as the sacred language of its followers. Its doctrines are based on the Pali Canon and are shared with the other major Buddhist sects, though followers of Theravada emphasize the need for one seeking enlightenment to be completely cleansed of impure impulses or emotions. Historically, the tradition expanded to Sri Lanka, from which missionaries travelled across South East Asia. Today, Sri Lanka, and most of South East Asia are the core lands of Theravada followers."

 ReligionShinto_desc:0 "Shinto is often described as the polytheistic religion of Japan which emerged out of various beliefs and practices developed on the island since prehistoric times. Followers of Shinto practice various festivals and traditions to honor their ancestors and community. The arrival and popularity of Buddhism caused Japanese society to syncretize the two beliefs to accommodate it for the people. However, in the nineteenth century the Japanese state openly controlled the religion and its doctrine, removing all Buddhist influence on Shintoism and making its observance mandatory. The government sought to use Shintoism not as a religion but as a philosophy to foster national unity and patriotism. State Shintoism was disbanded after World War II but many Japanese leaders are still attracted by the possibility of incorporating Shintoism to revitalize the nation."
 ReligionTraditionalEastern_desc:0 "Eastern religions are those that emerged in East, South, and Southeast Asia. They are based on different cultural, philosophical, and temporal periods when compared to religions which emerged in the West or Africa. Due to the populations and diversity of Asia, these religions were generally adaptable and spread among many populations. The recent advent of Western religion and philosophy during the periods of industrialization and colonialism challenged these religions to respond and adapt in order to preserve their influence."
 ReligionConfucian_desc:0 "Confucianism is a sophisticated system of behavior and thought that originated with the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius in the sixth century BCE. Practitioners of Confucianism pursue the unity of the individual with Heaven. This can be achieved only when the individual understands their humanity and builds a society and family of stability. For centuries the Chinese dynasties embraced Confucianism and relied heavily on its teachings to train the bureaucracy.  However, the emergence of Western power eventually pushed the government to suppress students from studying Confucianism in favor of Western fields. Despite its decline as a state religion, its philosophical principles remain a major influence across not just China but East Asia as a whole."

 ReligionIndoiranian_desc:0 "The Indo-Aryan people were said to have migrated into the Indian subcontinent from the steppe thousands of years ago. They brought languages and a cultural identity which stretched across all the areas these people settled. Today their descendants and linguistic legacy can be seen to connect peoples from Central Asia all the down to Iran and as far east as Bengal and Sri Lanka. Through these shared linguistic and cultural practices, they also brought and adapted to the local religious customs of the areas they settled."

 ReligionHindu_desc:0 "Hinduism in itself is not a singular religion but the synthesis of all the various religions and traditions of Ancient India. The Indo-Aryan Vedic tribes played a major role in the Hindu synthesis, and over the centuries the ability of Hinduism to adapt and synthesize various beliefs allowed it to grow, eventually supplanting Buddhism as the main religion in India. The advent of Islam and later Western colonialism brought new challenges to Hinduism as those religions were open challenges to the syncretic nature of Hinduism. A reform movement in the nineteenth century led to a revival in Hinduism that continues to the present day, it pushed the religion to focus more on the idea that the divine can be found within each person and directing Hindus to approach social problems with a modernist approach. Hindu populations can be seen across Asia, but it is most prominent in South Asia, especially India."
 ReligionSikh_desc:0 "One of the youngest major religions on the planet, Sikhism emerged in the late fifteenth century in South Asia. The religion is based on the teachings of Guru Nanak and the nine Gurus who succeeded him. Sikh beliefs and scriptures focus on the faith and meditation on the name of the one creator, divine unity among all people, and a belief in living for justice, peace, and as an honest person. Along with these beliefs is a rejection that any faith can truly know the absolute truth. The religion is identified as being heavily influenced by Hindu and Muslim religious traditions and despite intense persecution, especially by the Mughal Empire, it managed to grow through the conversion of both Hindus and Muslims. These periods of persecution caused the development of a sophisticated warrior tradition within the faith. Today Sikhism is prevalent across South Asia, but most concentrated in Punjab."
 ReligionJain_desc:0 "Jainism is an ancient Indian religion whose followers study two texts, the Agamas and Paramagams. Jains believe in several religious ideas, including non-violence, honest conduct, ascetism, and non-attachment. Many of its beliefs are related to elements of Hinduism. Followers of Jainism also make five vows which pledge to obey the principles of non-violence and ascetism among others. The strict, pacifist religion has several million devoted followers, mostly in India, though small communities of Jains are present across Asia."
 ReligionTraditionalIranian_desc:0 "Zoroastrianism is among the oldest religions on the planet. Its followers believe in the teachings of the ancient Iranian prophet Zoroaster. Practitioners of this faith believe in a dualistic cosmology of good versus evil which will end in the eventual defeat of evil. The principle text of the faith is Avesta. The religion grew under the patronage of the great Persian dynasties of antiquity. Alexander the Great displaced the faith but the Parthian Empire would revive it. However, the advent of Islam saw the number of Zoroastrians heavily decline due to conversion and at times suppression. Despite this, there are still practicing Zoroastrians in Iran and in small communities around South Asia."

 ReligionNoreligion_desc:0 "Throughout history most peoples have found themselves believing in or living under a specific religious worldview. However, recent centuries saw the growth of new scientific theories and philosophies that challenged the acceptance of any religious identity. The emergence of individual rights, secularism, new technologies in travel, and knowledge of other beliefs have all combined to allow individuals to identify as non-religious. This has led to the development of a variety of ways to look at the world or spiritually connect with it."

 ReligionIrreligious_desc:0 "This worldview consists of individuals who are indifferent to religion in general or of individuals who believe the human mind is incapable of comprehending whether a higher power exists or does not exist. These worldviews are rooted in secularism, and discussions related to it that emerged during the Age of Enlightenment in Europe. However, scholars can trace elements of these ideas in philosophers and writings of people from across the world and across all time. Modern writers suggest those writers could not openly profess their understanding of the world in fear of how the wider society would treat them."
 ReligionAtheist_desc:0 "Atheism is the non-belief in any deities. Throughout history such a belief was often very dangerous and anyone who subscribed to this view normally hid it. Although its presence can be detected as early as ancient South Asia and Greece. The Age of Enlightenment provided the space to allow atheists to finally emerge and articulate their beliefs. The advent of scientific advancements and belief in the certainty of science also pushed many into accepting atheism. Communism firmly embraces atheism and its growth in recent times has seen atheism promoted extensively by many communist states and parties."

 ReligionZionistChristian_desc:0 "This refers to the recent advent of new spiritual and religious beliefs on how the mind, body, or spirit can transform. A lot of New Age groups draw inspiration from the works of nineteenth and early twentieth century occultists and the growing post-war counter-culture movement. However, there are no precise definitions or origin for these groups as they cover a variety of beliefs. This diversity leads to unique groups where some draw inspiration from Eastern religions."
 ReligionStatist_desc:0 "Due to government propaganda and state control, a number of citizens in a given state view their political leader as a figure of almost religious significance. The idea of a political head being either worshiped or seen as a heavenly figure is not new. In East Asia, this was done extensively, especially in the Chinese and Japanese imperial dynasties. In Europe, many monarchs legitimized their rule as the will of God and their presence as ordained from heaven. Advances in technology and the advent of modern state institutions have allowed such ideas to be propagated to citizens through multiple avenues."
 ReligionCultistSafe_desc:0 "Cults are a group of people with a shared set of beliefs that are in opposition to an established authority. This authority can be a mainstream religion, a political authority, or societal norms, among other possibilities. Members of these cults may practice divergent beliefs or religions, but they are not propagating violence to its own members or the wider society. While many local communities may find such groups alienating and even upsetting, their lack of violence or interference with society, generally ensure the group does not become a concern to the state or wider society. However, they are often left in isolation so if they do become violent, it usually does not become wider known until their actions affect the wider society."
 ReligionCultistFatal_desc:0 "Cults are a group of people with a shared set of beliefs that are in opposition to an established authority. This authority can be a mainstream religion, a political authority, or societal norms, among other possibilities. Members of these cults practice divergent beliefs and propagate some form of violence, either within the group or to the wider society. This leads to clashes with local authorities and alienation with wider communities. More dangerously, the ideas of such cults can effect pockets of the population who may act on those teachings, making these types of cults very dangerous to police and state authorities."
 ReligionTraditionalAfrican_desc:0 "This refers to a diverse set of beliefs spread across the continent. Among the beliefs generally associated with traditional African faiths is a belief in venerating the dead, belief in spirits, a higher power, and traditional forms of medicine, among others. Researchers believe many of these beliefs originated in sub-Saharan Africa and over the centuries has spread across the continent. Of all the major religions practiced in the continent, these faiths are the only ones that originated from the continent itself. The faith is transmitted often through oral tradition and not written scripture."
 ReligionTraditionalAmerican_desc:0 "These refer to the traditional, spiritualistic beliefs of the indigenous people of the Americas. These beliefs vary drastically across the hemisphere, but many traditions believe in respecting ancestors and seeking harmony with nature. Although the advent of Western colonialism brought religious persecution along diseases which ravaged indigenous communities, these beliefs have continued into the present day. Followers learn of the faith not through scripture but through the passing of knowledge verbally from one generation to the next."
 ReligionTraditionalOceanic_desc:0 "The religions and traditions of the Oceanic are based on a deep cosmology and rooted in ritual. Many associate the friendliness in which early explorers were received by peoples in the region to these religious rituals which often called on followers to expect new arrivals. No doubt a consequence of the seafaring tradition and island cultures of the region. Although explorers brought new religions which became popular among the people, recent times have seen locals revive or rejoin traditional practices. Especially the rituals."
 ReligionChineseSalvationist_desc:0 "Religious naturalists view the natural world as the ultimate source of all significance and knowledge. Its followers believe only in nature does an individual find guidance. Supporters of this worldview express their beliefs through diverse means. Some adhere to ancient pagan ideas on nature and the role of man, which they feel modern religion disrupted. Others turn to shamans or even scientists for guidance and confirmation of their belief in the primacy of nature."
 ReligionMessianic_desc:0 "Furry-centric religions are a group of spiritual beliefs that often fall closely in line with New Age religions but with connections to the Furry subculture. There are a variety of Furry spiritual doctrines such as Furry-related otherkin denominations or quasi-religious furry lifestylers who have adopted a emotional/spiritual conection to real, fictional, or symbolic animals. A vast majority of this group is heavily cosmopolitan, social, and environmentalist and place great levels of value on art and aesthetics."
 ReligionOther_desc:0 "These are traditions and religions, often centuries old, that emerged among small communities or within specific geographic spaces. Often the isolation of such communities, due to either their small size or geographic limitations, has allowed these practices to continue without hinderance from more prevalent faiths. As technology and states grow more sophisticated, such communities will likely be more exposed to new ideas of religion."
