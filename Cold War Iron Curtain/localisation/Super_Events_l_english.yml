  SUPER_EVENT_SAMSON_OPTION_DESC:0 "Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines!" Then he pushed with all his might, and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it. Thus he killed many more when he died than while he lived.\n\nJudges 16:30"
  SUPER_EVENT_ANGOLAN_CIVIL_WAR_DESC:0 "The story is known perfectly well, for many years now the imperialists, when they realized that one day that colony could be liberated, they started organizing their movements. The province of Cabinda is rich with oil. That is one of the reasons the imperialists want to have power over Angola. They organized the FNLA using people from the CIA.\n-Fidel Castro"
  SUPER_EVENT_CUBAN_REVOLUTION_DESC:0 "The first duty of the revolutionaries is to tell the truth. Fooling the people, promoting illusions, always brings the worst consequences, and I believe that the people should be warned against excessive optimism. How did the Red Army win the war? By telling the truth. How did the dictatorship lose the war? By deceiving the soldiers.\n-Fidel Castro"

  SUPER_EVENT_VIETNAM_WITHDRAWL_DESC:0 "For it seems now more certain than ever, that the bloody experience of Vietnam is to end in a stalemate. To say that we are closer to victory today is to believe in the face of the evidence, the optimists who have been wrong in the past.\n\n-Walter Kronkite"

  SUPER_EVENT_SOVIET_AFGHAN_WAR_DESC:0 "We didn't push the Russians to intervene, but we knowingly increased the probability that they would...That secret operation was an excellent idea.

  SUPER_EVENT_STEVENSON_52_DESC:0 "Let's face it. Let's talk sense to the American people. Let's tell them the truth, that there are no gains without pains, that we are now on the eve of great decisions, not easy decisions, like resistance when you're attacked, but a long, patient, costly struggle which alone can assure triumph over the great enemies of man - war, poverty, and tyranny - and the assaults upon human dignity which are the most grievous consequences of each."
