 2_libya_tt:0 "§YThis focus will be autocompleted by an event"
 libya_news.1.d:0 "\nRecently, in May, the European drafted Bevin-Sforza plan was published publicly. The plan calls for a fifteen year trusteeship of Libya. The Italians, the previous colonizers, will retain control of the main population center Tripolitania while the U.K. and France will possess Cyrenaica and Fezzan respectively. This has created massive upheaval around the world, especially in the Arab World, the United States, and the Soviet Union"
 LBA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "   The very existence of Idris' Emirate of Cyrenaica is in danger from colonialism. Ever since British and Italian diplomats, Ernest Bevin and Carlo Sforza composed the Bevin-Sforza, Libya has been the center of international controversy. This widely condemned proposed partition of Italian Libya will split it between France in Fezzan-Garamtes, United Kingdom in Cyrenaica, and Italy in the population center of Tripolitania. The defacto ruler of the Cyrenaican Emirate, Idris I find himself in a complex and difficult situation. He will have to put his confidence in the United Nations and international support from the newly decolonized Arab world and the major powers of the day."

 LBA_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 " Libya going into the 1960s is mainly a depopulated empty desert, but its new found state capital from foreign oil extraction in the nation have made the political elites and Senussi aristocracy very wealthy while the average Libyan is still living in backwards accommodations. The Arab world has never been the same since world war two, but in cities like Tripoli, Cirte, and Bayda Pan-Arabism and Nasserist political views can be found among every demographic of the youth. Whatever Idris believes should be done to the Kingdom, the profound influence neighboring Nasserist Egypt has had on Libya over the past few years is inescapable."

 LBA.5.d:0 "    His Majesty, King Idris, has called upon Mohieddin Fikini to form a new cabinet for the current goals of the state. The new avenues of change being adopted by Fikini will be the attempt to abolish the federal system and form a unitary government, launch our first five years plan of development, and amend the 1951 constitution. We can only hope this will lead to a more united and safe Libya, given the flames of revolution in Cairo and Baghdad."
 LBA.9.d:0 "    The 1951 Constitution of Libya was originally created upon the integration of Fezzan and Tripolitania by the Cyrenaican Emirate under Emir Idris I, and has since become obsolete to the current wishes of our establishment. Changes in the new constitution drafted by Mohieddin Fikini include the adoption of a unitary state and the right to vote for Women."
 LBA.10.d:0 "   In admiration of the great legacy of Arab Egypt, Idris and the Libyan government have been inviting traveling teachers from neighboring Egypt to help teach our children. However, observers have noticed a focus in Egyptian history in the education and many of the teachers are youth which have openly Pan-Arabist beliefs which glorify Nasser and the Egyptian revolution..."
 LBA.13.d:0 "   King Idris has signed an agreement stating he will step down in favor of his next of kin, however this will not be in effect for a number of months and the government will need to establish a transitional regency. We shall tread carefully, however, as this may be in the interest of more radical factions in our country."
 LBA.11.d:0 "   The influence of Pan-Arabism can be seen infatuating every aspect of Libyan life. Whether it be Radio Cairo, or the Egyptian teacher, businessman, or teller, the youth have constant exposure to these radical ideas sweeping accross the Arab world."
 LBA.14.d:0 "   These previous months have been a very decisive factor in changing Libya's political situation. While his Majesty, King Idris, was absent receiving medical attention in Egypt, a small group of the officers assigned to signal companies stormed Bayda and Benghazi. Prince Hasan has renounced all claims to the throne and told the Libyan people to not resist the new government. Whether the RCC can assert their control throughout the country is yet to be seen. A young Bedouin named Muammar al-Qaddafi seems to have taken the lead of these officers and is essentially their de facto leader."
 LBA.15.d:0 "   In an attempt to unify Libya with the UAR, chairmen al-Qaddafi has joint created the organization knowns as the Federation of Arab Republics"
 LBA.16.d:0 "   The Arab world is changing, and many of our people don't believe Libya will change with it. Ideas such as Nasserism and Pan-Arabism have manifested into the United Arab Republic. Tensions have always been strained between Israel and Arabs since their first Zionist occupation of Palestine. We must learn to address these many issues"
 LBA.20.d:0 "   Muammar al-Qaddafi has resigned in protest from his position as chairmen of the RCC after disagreements of recently passed legislation. This dispute needs to be resolved, otherwise outside forces may be able to intervene in our revolution."
