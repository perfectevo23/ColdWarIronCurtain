 contra_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "The Contras rely on fear and intimidation to express themselves. Those who support them are often former thugs or greedy individuals desperate for cash provided by foreigners opposed to our revolution. As such it is not that hard for us to recruit locals in Contra controlled areas who are willing to do their patriotic duty and gather information for us. In a recent intelligence operation, we were able to successfully recruit a villager near a major Contra base. He has provided us invaluable information on their recruitment tactics, deployments, and level of arms supplies. More importantly, as many of the Contras shop or spend their free time in the village, we are also gaining information on future Contra offensives. From this information we are better able to deploy our forces in the area to counter their forces and were able to intercept several attempts by the Contras to bring new fighter in the area."
 contra_insurgency_options.2.d:0 "The Contras rely on fear and intimidation to express themselves. Those who support them are often former thugs or greedy individuals desperate for cash provided by foreigners opposed to our revolution. As such it is not that hard for us to recruit locals in Contra controlled areas who are willing to do their patriotic duty and gather information for us. In a recent intelligence operation, we were able to successfully recruit a villager in a Contra controlled area. The source at the time proved useful and provided intelligence that indicated a major Contra offensive in the area. We deployed forces to counter this upcoming offensive, but it ended up happening in a different area and the Contras drove off our unprepared forces. We realized our recruit was a double agent and had facilitated the Contra success. Our operation had been a failure."
 contra_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "The Contras are a cowardly lot, often only attacking from the jungles to target unarmed officials or innocent civilians. We deployed a force to protect several villages which were recently attacked. The Contras did not realize this, and we managed to discover their operating base in the area. During a daring raid, our forces were able to infiltrate and assault the Contra forces. Caught off guard their fighters took heavy casualties as they fled and ran, many abandoning their modern Western rifles. We took prisoners and captured documents. The villagers are gracious for our actions and the morale of our forces in the area increased."
 contra_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "The Contras are a cowardly lot, often only attacking from the jungles to target unarmed officials or innocent civilians. We deployed a force to protect several villages which were recently attacked. However, our commander made a mistake after identifying the base from which they were launching the attacks. When our soldiers moved to launch the assault, the Contras were preparing to move out and were on alert. They ended up spotting our forces and when the assault was launched our men faced an entrenched and prepared enemy. We took casualties and our soldiers were forced to withdraw. The defeat has allowed the Contras to move more aggressively in the area and the villagers in the area have lost confidence in the government."
 contra_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "We have a modest Air Force, but our pilots are full of revolutionary fervor. With the help of intelligence from a friendly power, we were able to discover the location of a Contra training camp out in the open. It appears they brazenly believe us incapable of striking the base as it is quite remote. However, we were able to send some of our planes with bombs and they hit the target directly. After the attack we learned from our intelligence that the base had been a large training camp and staging area for the rebels and after the strike it is no longer operational. Enemy capabilities in the area was depleted by this successful strike."
 contra_insurgency_options.6.d:0 "We have a modest Air Force, but our pilots are full of revolutionary fervor. With the help of intelligence from a friendly power, we were able to discover the location of a Contra training camp out in the open. We sent some of our planes to destroy the target which they did. However, intelligence intercepts and sources did not indicate the Contras took losses in the area. Confused, a small group of men investigated the site, it appears our planes may have targeted the wrong coordinates and instead hit an open field near a farmhouse. It appears there were no civilian casualties, but the bombing infuriated the locals who accused us of trying to drive them off their lands. The Contras are fueling such thoughts and have gained a boost in support."

 contra_insurgency_options.11.d:0 "The Contra forces latest offensive successfully isolated Managua from the rest of the country. Within the capital this led to many protestors demanding an end to the conflict, stretching the resources of an already thinned out Sandinista government. With an impending assault on the capital, the Sandinista government finally capitulated, calling for a ceasefire. The Contras accepted and within a day the Sandinista forces agreed to demobilize and surrender the capital. Victorious Contra forces across the country celebrated, amidst sporadic reports they committed acts of reprisals. A committee of the leading Contra leaders met the media in Managua, they claimed they would quickly establish a government and hold free elections. When asked about the fate of Sandinistas or their future participation in elections, they simply stated time would determine that answer. Although the international media claims the announcement of free elections as a step in the right direction, many in Nicaragua doubt they will actually occur."
 contra_insurgency_options.10.d:0 "The Sandinista government successfully marshalled its military forces to halt the advance of the Contras. Recent offensives drove Contras out of their safe havens and away from the population. With the Contras capabilities greatly weakened and in the face of international pressure to end the fighting, the Sandinistas decided to hold talks with the Contras. The defeated Contras agreed to demobilize their fighters and halt attacks against civilians. Upon the demobilization of the Contras, the government agreed to hold elections under international observers from across the region. Although the Contras and their backers tried to push the demobilization commitment, the reality of their military situation meant they had no choice but to end their struggle. Nicaraguans are looking forward to peace and an election held in a positive atmosphere. The Sandinista government is receiving international praise for their even handed approach to ending the Contra threat."
 contra_insurgency_Decisions:0 "The Contra War"
 contra_insurgency_Decisions_desc:0 "The remnants of the Samoza regime, anti-Samoza fighters betrayed by the leftists who took power, and anti-communist Nicaraguans have joined together to form the Contras. They are united in their opposition against the socialist Sandinista government and their encroachments on their rights and way of life. They have strong ties with the United States and other anti-communist states. The Sandinista government is organizing its own forces to face this threat and preserve their revolution. Nicaraguan peasants are caught in between both sides as they desperately fight over the future destiny of Nicaragua.\n\nCurrent Strength [?.contra_insurgency]%"

There are 8 basic parts to the GUI. \n 1. The top left screen shows the nuclear powers of the world- in other words, who has armed their stockpile through the political tab policy. \n 2. The Defcon screen shows your Defcon level, and is only available to the USA, USSR, and PRC. Moving the level down will indicate a higher stage of tension.\n \n 3. The middle section of the GUI shows how many of each kind of WMD you have, from vanilla nukes to ICBMs. The Chemical Weapons list on the far right is a WIP, and the denuclearize bit- well, why would you want to do that, anyway? \n 4. Underneath the section discussed in 3 are 3 options, for a level 1, 2, or 3 strike, each offering different amounts of nukes used and different targets. Level 1 is a basic attack on enemy capitals in range. Level 2 is level 1, plus extra nukes for strategic targets, ie. large population or industrial centers. Level 3 is a full, all out, nuclear broadside, and requires one of 2 things- ICBM technology, or for the USSR or USA, missiles in Cuba or Turkey, respectively. \n 5. The big greyed out nuclear button will turn red if all requirements for launch are met, and then you get to play global thermonuclear warfare. \n 6. Underneath the big button is a list of nukes required for the strike. \n 7. To the left of that is a State target list for the strike. \n 8. To the left of that is a list of enemy countries in range of your missiles. \n\n Remember, if you experience any bugs or problems with this system, don’t hesitate to list them on steam or discord. \n\n Happy Bombing!"
