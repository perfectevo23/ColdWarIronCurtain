 decolonization.25.d:0 "The West Indies Federation came into existence today following the passage of the British Caribbean Federation Act. The new political union unites over twenty major islands and nearly two hundred and fifty smaller islands into ten provinces with a federal center. The British hope the Federation will be able to transition its now former colonial islands into a fully independent state. London sees the Federation as a response to the increased pressure from subjects in the islands for independence while also ensuring independence will result in a viable state not dependent on London. Some residents, especially from the larger islands cautiously welcome this new state but express anxiety to questions of how centralized the Federation will be. Some anti-colonial activists see the Federation as merely continued British exploitation and only immediate independence would end centuries of colonial oppression to the people of the islands. However, it appears most people welcome the news and hope this will mark a new period of independence and development for the people."

 decolonization.26.d:0 "The anti-colonial struggle in Portuguese Guinea and Cape Verde continued to move closer to peace. In a referendum held on Cape Verde, the island’s population overwhelmingly voted in favor of accepting an independent National Assembly presented by the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). The other option was to reject independence from Portugal. Although violent anti-colonial activity did not occur on Cape Verde, Cape Verdeans actively participated in the conflict on the mainland and had several leading politicians operating within PAIGC. Senior party member and Cape Verdean Aristides Pereira is expected to take power once Portugal officially leaves. He served in senior positions within the PAIGC and helped organize strikes and anti-colonial protests on Cape Verde, ensuring his people were engaged in the independence struggle. The referendum reflects the Portuguese shift to embracing decolonization to resolve its conflict in Portuguese Guinea. The only potential stumbling block for the new state of Cape Verde is the internal debate about whether the country should seek unification with Guinea Bissau or maintain its independence."

 decolonization.27.d:0 "São Tomé and Príncipe had been a Portuguese colony since the Portuguese first arrived on the uninhabited islands in the late fifteenth century. It became a site of sugar plantations and a major slave trade center in the region. Eventually, cocoa and coffee also became major exports for the island but its history with slavery and forced labor hung a cloud over the relationship between the majority African population on the islands and Portugal. As the clamor for decolonization grew following World War II, a socialist party of São Toméans formed called the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe (MLSTP). Although the MLSTP did not engage in violence, it did establish a base and advocated against Portuguese colonialism. Following the decision by Portugal to embrace decolonization, local colonial authorities engaged with the MLSTP and began a transition to independence for the islands. In a national referendum the people voted for a constituent assembly where the MLSTP won every seat, marking the end of Portuguese rule on the island. MLSTP leader Manuel Pinto da Costa is expected to become head of state for the new nation."

 newsdecolonization.28.d:0 "The British took possession of Mauritius during the early nineteenth century and contended with economic and social problems due to the island’s dependence on sugar and diverse labor force. Today, the island has a new constitution and proclaimed their independence. For several years the British had identified Mauritius as a space for independence but its efforts to transition the colony to an independent state has not been smooth. The diverse population and labor groupings led to sectarian violence over the country’s future just weeks before the election. The British military had to deploy troops to end the rioting. However, despite these uncertainties, many are hopeful for the future. The new parliament will be led by Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam of the ruling Labour Party. In reaction, the student organization called the Mauritian Militant Wing (MMW) under Paul Berenger already proclaimed itself the main opposition group to the ruling Labour Party. The MMW offers a socialist alternative to the Labour Party. Despite the violence and early political challenges, many are optimistic the new nation will be able to achieve its national interests."
 newsdecolonization.29.d:0 "In French Comoros, the island’s parliament voted to declare unilateral independence from France. The French are said to be surprised by this decision as they expected to grant independence in 1978. Referendums had been held several years earlier regarding independence on the four islands of the Comoros, three voted for independence and Mayotte abstained, the new state consists of all the Comoros islands except Mayotte. The Chief Minister of Comoros Ahmed Abdallah has announced the independence vote and is the first president of Comoros. Tensions on the island are high as the large Francophile community sees this move as detrimental to the nation’s development. On the other side, socialists see the parliament and Ahmed Abdallah as too centrist to provide meaningful change. Whether these tensions will lead to political turmoil remains unknown, but the independence decision has elicited anger from Paris over the actions of Comoros nationalists. It is expected France will likely cut ties to the islands and strengthen its hold on Mayotte, perhaps overtime relations can be restored with France and her now former colony."
 newsdecolonization.30.d:0 "The Seychelles were originally uninhabited until Europeans began arriving in the sixteenth century, by the early nineteenth it was a crown colony of Britain. The island historically had a robust plantation system which exported cash crops but since the establishment of an international airport, it has become a major tourist destination. With its economic future heading in a positive direction, the British government announced plans to give Seychelles independence. James Mancham, a lawyer from a prominent family established the Seychelles Democratic Party (SDP) in reaction to Britain’s plans for independence. Mancham’s party had dominated the provincial elections held during the transitory period and London announced today this transitory period was finished. James Mancham will be President of an independent Seychelles and in a public statement he announced his nation would be a republic within the Commonwealth. The socialist opposition party, the People’s United Party lacks seats in the National Assembly but do enjoy a strong following across the islands and have been given the position of Prime Minister in the National Assembly. Future success for Seychelles will be determined by if the two major political parties can come together to address the need for rapid economic growth with the protection of working-class citizens."
 decolonization.34.d:0 "The UN’s objective of providing independence within 10 years for the people of Somaliland was finally fulfilled with the Italian Somaliland gaining independence from Italy today. The newly formed Somaliland simultaneously united with British Somaliland, which gained their own independence just a few days before. The unification immediately brought the Somali Republic into existence, with a government forming by Abdullahi Issa and Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal along with other members of the trusteeship and protectorate governments, with Haji Bashir Ismail Yusuf as President of the Somali National Assembly, Aden Abdullah Osman Daar as President of the Somali Republic, and Abdirashid Ali Shermarke as Prime Minister. However, the UN’s rushed push for the 10 year independence was exposed of its downside as the republic appears to still be under heavy colonial influence both amongst the people and the government. For now, the fate of the land of Somalia relies upon the republic."
 decolonization.40.d:0 "After a promise made a decade ago in 1942 by the former Queen Wilhelmina stating that all overseas territories of the Kingdom of the Netherlands would gain some form of autonomy, today in December, 1954 marks the official beginning of the Netherlands Antilles after being issued by royal decree three years earlier. It will allow for increased autonomy and without our government having to manage each individual island. Each island will have a Lieutenant-governor who will report to the Governor-general in Curacao in an effort to centralize the territories. The Netherlands Antilles shall consist of Curacao, Bonaire, Aruba, Sint Maarten, Sint Eustatius, and Saba with their official currency being the Netherlands Antillean guilder. Their government will be run by a parliament and a council of ministers with the Prime Minister as the head of government in Willemstad, the capital on the island of Curacao. Hopefully this will quell the unrest and struggle for independence that was sparked during short American control in the Second World War."
 decolonization.42.d:0 "This week our parliament ratified the Madrid Accords, a treaty handing over Spanish Sahara to Mauritania and Morocco. Ever since the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514 we have been intensely pressured by the cursed organization to give up our few minor African territories, despite our classification of them as internal provinces. While most high ranking members in the government wanted an independent Spanish aligned Sahrawis Republic, the pressure from Mauritania and Morocco both demanding their full annexation of the province along with a newly formed separatist group, made these accords the most logical approach."
 newsdecolonization.42.d:0 "After years of pressure from the UN general assembly on Spain to decolonize their Saharan territories an agreement was finally made in the light of the newly formed Polisario Front insurgency. Spain attempted to delay its decolonization by combining its North African holdings into the 'internal province' of Spanish Sahara, and briefly defeating the local militant organizations. However, after Morocco made a 350,000 citizen march into Spanish Sahara in a demonstration to 'Moroccanize' the province it was then clear to Spain that Morocco was willing to wage war over the territory. In a hastily fashioned treaty the Madrid Accords were signed this week by the Spanish parliament as Fransisco Franco lies in a coma"

The people of Dominica will now be able to forge their own path. However, with the CIA lurking in the shadows, believe the new path won’t be too different from the old one."

 decolonization.46.d:0 "Originally a French colony, the small island was a battle ground between neighboring British colonies. In total, Saint Lucia has been exchanged between France and Britain 14 times before finally being settled as a British colony. On February 22, 1979, after almost 400 years of European intervention, neither a French, nor a British flag waved atop the island. Today, an independent Saint Lucian flag stood tall in the capital."

 newsdecolonization.50:0 "Following Jamaicas withdrawal from the West Indies Federation, Trinidad and Tobago have declared independence. One of the oldest colonies in the region under the British empire, Trinidad and Tobago hasn’t had autonomy since 1498, when Columbus stumbled on it like a bumbling fool. With the two islands fate in there own hands, many wonder what course they will take."
